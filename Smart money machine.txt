Strategy: The "Smart Money" Time Machine

Here is the plan to capture Closing Line Strength, which is indeed one of the most powerful signals in betting.

1. How it will work (The Architecture)
We need to build a "Time Machine" because a single webpage visit only tells us now, not then.

The Vault (history.json): I will create a system that saves a "snapshot" of the odds every time we scrape.
The Baseline: The first time you run the scraper for a race (e.g., in the morning), that becomes our "Opening Line".
The Signal: Every subsequent scrape compares the Current Odds vs. Opening Odds.
📉 Steamer (Good): Odds are dropping (e.g., 5.0 $\to$ 3.5). This means heavy money is being bet. We will boost this horse's score.
📈 Drifter (Bad): Odds are rising (e.g., 3.0 $\to$ 5.5). The market doesn't like them. We will penalize.
2. How YOU help (The "Sentinel" Role)
Since this runs on your local machine, the "Time Machine" only runs when your computer is on.

Option A (Manual): You leave the server running and click "Analyze" every hour or so manually.
Option B (Automatic): I can build a "Auto-Scrape" toggle. You turn it on, leave the tab open, and it scrapes every 10 minutes automatically in the background.
Shall I implement Option B (Auto-Scrape) so you can just leave it running and build up that rich data history?


Here are 4 advanced strategies we can layer on top of your Time-Series data to take accuracy to the next level.

Since we will have a "movie" of the market instead of just a "snapshot," we can spot these patterns:

1. The "Sharp vs. Soft" Divergence 🧠
The Concept: Not all bookies are equal. "Sharp" bookies (like Pinnacle or the Betfair Exchange) are smarter and react to injury news/insider info first. "Soft" bookies (like Paddy Power/SkyBet) react slower and attract the general public.
The Signal:
✅ BULLISH: Sharp odds drop (e.g., 4.0 $\to$ 3.5) but Soft odds stay high (4.0). Action: Bet immediately at the Soft bookie (Value).
❌ BEARISH: Soft odds drop (public hype) but Sharp odds stay high or drift. Action: Avoid. It's "dumb money."

2. The "Fake Drift" (The U-Turn) ↩️
The Concept: Sometimes insiders let a horse "drift" (odds get worse) all morning to get a better price, then hammer it 10 minutes before the race.
The Signal:
09:00: Odds 5.0
13:00: Odds 8.0 (Drifting... public ignores it)
13:50 (10 mins to post): Odds crash to 4.5.
Action: This "U-Turn" is often the strongest signal of all. We can detect this Price Velocity change instantly.

3. The "Trainer Steam" Effect 🚂
The Concept: Markets are emotional. If Willie Mullins wins the 1:30 race, the public will blindly bet his horse in the 2:10 race, crashing its odds artificially.
The Signal:
If a Trainer has a winner in the previous race, watch their next runner.
Fade Strategy: If the odds shorten purely because of the previous win (no other data support), the horse is likely Overvalued. We bet against it (or look for value elsewhere).

4. Support & Resistance Levels (Technical Analysis) 📊
The Concept: Just like stock trading, odds have psychological barriers.
The Signal:
A horse might bounce off 3.0 (2/1) multiple times. If it finally breaks below 3.0, it often free-falls to 2.5 or lower.
We can program the bot to alert you: "Horse X just broke the 3.0 resistance level - Steam is building!"
which of these sounds most exciting to you? (I personally love #2, the "U-Turn", as it catches the bookies off guard).
