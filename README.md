# BrianAI Cheltenham 2026: Deep Reasoning Ensemble

A state-of-the-art Horse Racing Predictor that moves beyond simple statistics to perform **Ensemble Intelligence Synthesis**.

## 🧠 The Engine: Multi-Source Consensus
Unlike standard predictors, this engine utilizes a **12-source Intelligence Stream** to generate its verdicts:

1.  **Professional Collective (10 Sources):** Synthesizes narratives from *Timeform, Sporting Life, At The Races, GeeGeez, Betfair Hub, Irish Racing, The Guardian, GG.co.uk, Tote Blog,* and *Sky Sports Racing*.
2.  **Social Discovery (2 Sources):** Scours *X (Twitter)* and *Reddit (r/horseracing)* for "Shadow Form" and "Stable Whispers" that official reports miss.

## 🛡️ Key Features
*   **Mission-Critical Scheduling:** Automated research phases triggered Daily, 5h before post-time, and 1h before the off.
*   **Narrative Vault:** Persistent long-term memory (`deep_reasoning_history.json`) that tracks horse stories even when they move in/out of the live markets.
*   **Consensus Detection:** Automatically flags an **"Alpha Narrative"** when multiple elite analysts (e.g., Timeform & ATR) agree on a hidden tactical edge.
*   **Market Velocity Tracking:** Real-time "Smart Money" detection that measures the speed of odds movements, not just the direction.

## 🚀 Architecture
*   **Backend:** Node.js / Express
*   **Scraping Layer:** Puppeteer-Extra with Stealth Plugin
*   **Reasoning Engine:** Custom Narrative Synthesis Logic
*   **Frontend:** Vanilla JS / CSS (Vibrant High-Data Dashboard)

## 💾 Data Strategy
The system utilizes a split-JSON architecture:
*   `history.json`: High-speed live stats and active AI picks.
*   `deep_reasoning_history.json`: The "Long-Term Memory" archive of every professional quote and social whisper found.
